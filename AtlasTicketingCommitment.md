# **Atlas Ticketing Commitment** 


These Terms of Service ('Terms') detail the conditions of the Atlas Ticketing Guarantee Service, which is automatically provided to a customer of Atlas (“you” or “your” as the case may be) utilizing Atlas' ticketing services. Please review these Terms carefully. By purchasing a ticket from Atlas, you are automatically enrolled in the Atlas Ticketing Guarantee Service, and you agree to abide by these Terms as well as all applicable laws and regulations.  

1. **Discrepancy in Ticket Information**
   
   In the event of a discrepancy between the ticket issued by Atlas and the passenger information, travel dates, flight numbers, or any required additional information that was provided by you to Atlas (“Discrepancy”). For the avoidance of doubt, Atlas bears no liability for your mistakes, the Customer shall notify Atlas without delay of this Discrepancy.  Atlas will provide a remedy to the Customer at Atlas' discretion, always ensuring that the passenger is provided a ticket to the original intended destination. If the passenger misses their flight as a result of such a discrepancy, you are required to notify Atlas within 4 hours from the original flight departure time. Atlas shall offer the following remedies: 
    -  1.1. Atlas will provide a ticket of the same service level and reimburse up to $150 for losses incurred, including but not limited to hotel and train expenses.
      
    -  1.2. Atlas will issue a full refund and an additional compensation of $30. 


2. **Sold-Out Flights**
   
   Where you have utilised the deposit method to pay for a ticket, and a ticket is listed as available at the time of order, if by the time Atlas issues the ticket, the original chosen flight by the passenger has been sold out, Atlas provides two forms of compensation: 
   -  2.1. Atlas will provide a ticket for an alternative flight of the same service level.
     
   -  2.2. Atlas will issue a full refund and an additional compensation of $30.


3. **Handling of Airline PNR Status Anomalies**
   
   - 3.1. Atlas will routinely monitor the PNR status of issued orders. Upon detection of a PNR cancellation by the airline, a message will appear in the "Incident Management" module. In case a ticket reissuance is required, you must notify Atlas within 24 hours of receiving such notification that you wish to reissue the ticket.
   
   - 3.2. In the event that Atlas fails to detect an unforeseen cancellation of the ticket by the airline, resulting in the passenger being at the airport without a confirmed booking, please contact Atlas on the day of the original flight departure. Atlas will offer the following remedies:
      - 3.2.1. Atlas will provide a ticket of the same service level and reimburse up to $150 for losses incurred, including but not limited to hotel and train expenses.
      - 3.2.2. Atlas will issue a full refund and an additional compensation of $30. 

      
4. **Airline Flight Cancellations or Schedule Changes**
   
    - 4.1. Notifications of any flight cancellations or schedule changes by airlines will be dispatched to the email provided by you at the time of order placement. Ensuring the accuracy of the email address provided is the your responsibility. If you are using Atlas's email service, refer to the relevant terms of the Atlas Email Service.
   
    - 4.2. In cases where a passenger files a claim against the airline based on Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament, and the airline requests compensation from Atlas due to insufficient notification to the passenger, you are obligated to assist Atlas by providing evidence of receiving such flight change notifications. If compensation is required, Atlas may deduct the entire amount claimed by the airline from your deposit account.
